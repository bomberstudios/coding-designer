### The ‘whys’ and ‘why nots’ of using code as part of the design process.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last couple of years, you know there's an open debate about the issue of whether a designer should know how to code or not.

For me, the question is akin to whether a graphic designer should know how to print a poster or not. Most of them don't, and are perfectly capable of producing great work. However, if your piece requires a complex printing process or some finish that is a bit out of the ordinary, knowing the ins and outs of printing will help you *a lot*.

Of course, if your printer is a *very* good friend you can get almost the same results than if you printed the piece yourself. But then you're missing on another benefit of knowing *how* stuff is printed…

**You can *create* techniques**. Come up with your own, unique ways of producing design.

That alone, for me, justifies the price of admission.

However, not all is gold that glitters: learning how to code will make you a **worse designer** for a while.

Yup.

- Remember the first time you opened Illustrator. Did everything feel alien, and weird, and complex?
- Remember what happens when you fall in love with a new typography. Suddenly you're trying to use it for anything and everything, even when it doesn't work.
- What about glossy buttons, background noise, Metro-style UIs, or pretty much any fad that took Dribbble by storm? Were you able to \*not\* use them?

Coding will make you feel like that, only worse.

Whenever you introduce a new tool or technique in your arsenal, there's a period where you tend to overuse it until you feel comfortable enough with it to make it invisible. That period is particularly long and noticeable with code.

**It takes *a lot* of time for code to become invisible**.

If you are not willing to spend that much time, I honestly recommend you to invest your scarce spare time on something else. Typography, color theory, animation or storytelling can bring you great joy in a short time, without any side effects.
