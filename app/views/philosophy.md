### a *modern* design process

## The *whys* and *why nots* of using code as part of the design process.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last couple of years, you know there's an open debate about the issue of whether a designer should know how to code or not.

For me, the question is akin to whether a graphic designer should know how to print a poster or not. Most of them don't, and are perfectly capable of producing great work. However, if your piece requires a complex printing process or some finish that is a bit out of the ordinary, knowing the ins and outs of printing will help you *a lot*.

Of course, if your printer is a *very* good friend you can get almost the same results than if you printed the piece yourself. But then you're missing on another benefit of knowing *how* stuff is printedâ€¦

**You can *create* techniques**. Come up with your own, unique ways of producing design.

That alone, for me, justifies the price of admission.
